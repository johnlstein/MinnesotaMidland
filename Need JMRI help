I've been a user of CMRI/JMRI for 30 years, but have run into a problem that has be stumped.  
A few months ago my aged XP computer died and I replaced it with a Windows 7 laptop.
It does not have an RS232 port, so I purchased and installed a USB/RS232 conversion cable.
I cannot establish two way communication to the railroad.  I can initialize the railroad,
and successfully transmit data which is properly interpreted and acted upon by the various
devices (relays, switch motors, signals, etc.
I can send a poll request, and the USIC responds with the proper indicator lights showing
that the USIC is transmitting data back to the computer.  Indicator lights on the RS232/RS422
interface card also show the USIC's response.  But, the computer does not respond to the
inputted data.  It times out, then repeats the poll request.
I have tried a replacement USB/RS232 conversion cable to no avail.
I have tried loopback tests, and the CMRI Monitor shows the transmitted test data is properly
returned.

What could be the problem?  Is there an internal software switch that is causing returned data
to be ignored?

Appreciate any suggestions.      --John
